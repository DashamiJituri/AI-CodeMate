# AI-CodeMate: Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is part of an internship task focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. The goal is to uncover survival patterns using Python tools like pandas and matplotlib.

---

## 📊 Task Summary

- **Dataset Used**: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (Kaggle)
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 What I Did

1. Loaded the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`)
2. Cleaned the data (handled missing values and corrected data types)
3. Analyzed survival patterns based on:
   - Gender
   - Passenger class (Pclass)
   - Age, family size, and port of embarkation
4. Visualized findings using bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Gender and class significantly influenced survival
- Data cleaning is critical before analysis
- Visualization makes interpretation easier
