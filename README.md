# AI-CodeMate: Titanic Survival Prediction & Financial Chatbot

This project is part of an internship task series involving:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
- **Model creation** to predict survival using logistic regression.
- **A basic rule-based chatbot** to answer predefined financial queries.

## 📌 Task Summary

### ✅ Task 1: EDA on Titanic Dataset
Performed exploratory analysis using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to uncover survival patterns.

### ✅ Task 2: Logistic Regression Model
Built and evaluated a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival based on selected features.

### ✅ Task 3: Model Deployment (Optional)
Saved the trained model (`titanic_logistic_model.pkl`) using `joblib` for later use.

### ✅ Task 4: Financial Chatbot (Rule-Based)
Created a simple Python chatbot that can answer predefined financial questions like:
- "What is the total revenue?"
- "How has net income changed over the last year?"
- "What is the profit margin?"

> This was implemented as a basic script to simulate interaction and demonstrate logic handling with conditional statements.
